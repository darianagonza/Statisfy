![Statisfy Hex Sticker](man/figures/statisfy_hex.png)

The **Statisfy** package is a statistician's best friend. After using this 
package, hardworking statisticians can't help but be left with a big smile on 
their face (just look at our hex sticker). Statisfy is designed to streamline 
common statistical tasks with user-friendly functions that identify outliers, 
output summary statistics, check if data follows a normal distribution, and even 
suggest statistical tests that are appropriate for the user's needs.


## Installation

You can install the development version of Statisfy like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("darianagonza/Statisfy")
```
## Example Dataset

Statisfy comes with a built-in dataset, `thesis_data`, which is a subset of a 
larger dataset containing ecological data from Odzala-Kokoua National Park in 
the Republic of Congo. This data was collected and provided by Dariana Gonzalez, 
who is using the data for her senior thesis. 

Here's a quick look at the data:
```{r}
library(Statisfy)
head(thesis_data)
```
## Package features 

### 1. Check for normality using `checkNormality()`

Determine whether a numeric variable in a dataset follows a normal distribution 
by inputting the dataframe, the variable, and a line color into `checkNormality()`. 
The function will output a histogram of the variable, a QQ plot, and the results 
of a Shapiro-Wilk test, providing a definitive answer for whether the variable 
indeed follows a normal distribution. This function can be a prerequisite  for 
the function `whichTest()`, which is described later on. 

Let's take a look two quick examples: 

```{r}
# Not normally distributed (choose a nonparametric statistical test)
checkNormality(data = thesis_data, rel_humidity, line_color = "blue")

# `ecosystem` is not a numeric variable, so the function will return an error
# The .Rmd will not render if the function is actually run, but this is how this 
# example would look:
# checkNormality(data = thesis_data, ecosystem, line_color = "red")
```

### 2. Choose the right form of statistical analysis using `whichTest()`

With dozens of statistical tests available, it is often difficult to know which 
one is most appropriate for which occasion. `whichTest()` addresses this issue 
by taking in up to two variables and, based on the class of the data and the 
number and levels of the variables, outputs a parametric and non-parametric 
statistical test that can be used to analyze those variables. 

```{r}
# One numeric variable and one categorical variable (with 3 levels) 
whichTest(data = thesis_data, var1 = "temp_air", var2 = "ecosystem")

# Two numeric variables
whichTest(data = thesis_data, var1 = "temp_air", var2 = "rel_humidity")

# One categorical variable
whichTest(data = thesis_data, var1 = "ecosystem")
```
### 3. Use `outliers()` to detect outliers

`outliers()` allows the user to identify which points within a numeric variable 
deviate significantly from the mean and set the percentile thresholds that will 
be used to identify those outliers. By default, this function uses the 1st and 
99th percentiles. 

```{r}
outliers(thesis_data$temp_air, upper = 0.92, lower = 0.08)
```
### 4. Calculate key statistics using `stats()`

In order to choose between more advanced forms of statistical analysis, sometimes 
users must have more detailed summary statistics of their data, including 
information about dispersion. `stats()` helps the user obtain more detailed 
statistics on a numeric variable that summary() cannot provide, and it does so 
in the form of a nice APA-style table (ready for publication!).

```{r}
stats(thesis_data$rel_humidity)
```
### Authors

This package was designed by Dariana Gonzalez and Yahir Santillan for a STAT 108 
final project.
